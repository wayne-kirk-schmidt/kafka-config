Kafka Config
============

These are sample configuration files for a kafka and zookeeper configuration.

*   there are configuration files for a stand alone server

*   there are configuration files for a cluster of servers

*   there are configuration files for logging for both kafka and zookeeper

Installing the Scripts
=======================

The scripts are designed to be used within a batch script or DevOPs tool.

There is an installation tool for the scripts, though expected to use a DevOps tool.

The configuration files contain variables ( for example: %%KSVRIP01%% ) as placeholders.

The installation methods will replace these variables when installing the files.

Dependencies

    1. ./bin - has all of the scripts here

    2. ./etc - has all of the configuration files

To Do List:
